## ⚙️ Features
- 🔍 Real-time monitoring and detection of leakage  
- 📱 Alert notifications when leakage is detected  
- 💾 Logs data for analysis and reporting  
- ⚡ Fast and reliable detection using sensors  
- 🧠 Simple and user-friendly interface  

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- **Arduino / Microcontroller** (for sensor input)  
- **Sensors** (water/gas sensor for leakage detection)  
- **Buzzer / LED indicators** (for alert mechanism)  
- **C/C++ / Embedded C* (for control logic)
- Python (for business logic)
- **Optional:** NodeMCU or ESP8266 for IoT integration

## 🧩 Working Principle
1. Sensors continuously monitor for leakage.  
2. If leakage is detected, the microcontroller processes the input signal.  
3. The system triggers the alert (buzzer/light) and optionally sends a notification.  
4. The event is logged for record-keeping or display.  

---

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Connect all components as per the circuit diagram.  
2. Upload the source code to your microcontroller using the Arduino IDE.  
3. Power on the system and observe sensor readings.  
4. The alert mechanism will trigger if leakage is detected.

## 📊 Future Improvements
- Integration with mobile apps or cloud for IoT alerts  
- Data analytics dashboard for monitoring trends  
- Auto shut-off mechanism during severe leakage
